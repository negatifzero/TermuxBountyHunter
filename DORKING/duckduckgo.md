```text
Operator filetype:
The official site states that it supports only these extensions: pdf, doc(x), xls(x), ppt(x), html.
The personal research has shown that it can also return results for other file types (eg txt, zip). It looks like if it does not find anything relevant, it tries to return smth similar. For instance if you are looking for txt, the engine might send you some json results.
